#summary Adam's thoughts on how the project is progressing.

== 2009-04-06 ==
I figure its time to start keeping a blog on my adventures with Openoffice and natural languages. Mostly for my personal musings but if this helps anyone else all the better.

After spending most of the weekend trying to get an OpenOffice plugin to work with no success I'm about to try another approach, and grab the source of an existing tool (called Language Tool) and strip out its logic and use it as a shell for our plugin. It gives me respect for Marcin Mi≈Çkowski, the developer of the LT oo plugin. Almost every time I've found myself stuck against a wall and go googling I find an old mailing list post from Marcin detailing his previous adventures.

Well now that I've had a quick interlude I'm going to make a start stripping his brilliant little app and see if I cant track down my issue.
